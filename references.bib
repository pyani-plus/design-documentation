  title     = "Shifting the genomic gold standard for the prokaryotic species
               definition",

  abstract  = "DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) has been used for nearly 50 years as
               the gold standard for prokaryotic species circumscriptions at
               the genomic level. It has been the only taxonomic method that
               offered a numerical and relatively stable species boundary, and
               its use has had a paramount influence on how the current
               classification has been constructed. However, now, in the era of
               genomics, DDH appears to be an outdated method for
               classification that needs to be substituted. The average
               nucleotide identity (ANI) between two genomes seems the most
               promising method since it mirrors DDH closely. Here we examine
               the work package JSpecies as a user-friendly, biologist-oriented
               interface to calculate ANI and the correlation of the
               tetranucleotide signatures between pairwise genomic comparisons.
               The results agreed with the use of ANI to substitute DDH, with a
               narrowed boundary that could be set at approximately 95-96\%. In
               addition, the JSpecies package implemented the tetranucleotide
               signature correlation index, an alignment-free parameter that
               generally correlates with ANI and that can be of help in
               deciding when a given pair of organisms should be classified in
               the same species. Moreover, for taxonomic purposes, the analyses
               can be produced by simply randomly sequencing at least 20\% of
               the genome of the query strains rather than obtaining their full
               sequence.",
