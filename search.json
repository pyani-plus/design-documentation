Please see the section on submitting changes below.\n\n\nThis documentation is written in Quarto and can, technically, be edited in any standard code editor (e.g. VS Code, Emacs or Vim). However, it may be most convenient to edit the project using RStudio Desktop, which has native Quarto and git/GitHub integration.\nThe repository is an RStudio project, which is defined in the design-docs.Rproj file (.Rproj files are the definition files for these projects). To open the project, either open the .Rproj file from within RStudio Desktop, or double-click the file in your file manager window. The project should open in RStudio Desktop, if it is installed.",
